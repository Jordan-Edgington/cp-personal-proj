# Munch Memo

> CP Whiskey Platoon Personal Capstone Project

Munch Memo is an educational project designed to allow users to keep track of how many calories they are consuming. It uses [FatSecret API](https://platform.fatsecret.com/platform-api) to keep track of the calories, and [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) to allow users to generate meals based on a desired calorie count. It also allows users to view the meals of other users and to comment on these meals.

## Requirements and Architecture

> Requirements

We were required to create an application that utilizes two external APIs and has two fully CRUDable sources (not including user authentication).

> Architecture

Munch memo is built with React w/ Javascript to make the front-end and Django w/ Django Rest Framework and a PostgreSQL database to make the back-end.
